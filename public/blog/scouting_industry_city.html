                Industry city is a collection of 16 buildings. The first ten buildings are placed in a row liked fashion on third avenue between 32nd and 41st street. The other buildings are on 2nd avenue at the corner on 37th street. The other six buildings are not so obvious by the way. It took a lady working at the lobby to tell me their location.

                Walking inside the building, I didn’t know what to expect. I believe the first building I walked inside of was building six. Touring the space, I didn’t know if this was a depressed mall, a set for a zombie movie, or just a plain old abandoned building. I found a guy hanging out at the courtyard smoking and decided to approach him.

                Having had my fill talking to my new friend, I decided to start traversing buildings and see what all this was about. As I got my bearing, I began to understand how Industry City was laid out. It is a row of buildings with courtyards between each pair. Courtyard 5/6 has an Ince skating ring but each courtyard has their own little thing going for it. Many of these courtyards had cliche street art on them except one.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As I toured courtyard one and two, something tells me to go all the way down its corridor. The minute I look right after passing a corridor, I discover this amazing street art of an astronaut. You have to follow that scout intuition, it never fails!

                Anyway, I continue exploring through buildings and start checking out their workspace. Industry city is laid in a fashion where food and retail is on the first floor, while office spaces are on the floors above. I go upstairs and notice the typical polished corporate environment you often see. There was even a start up co-working space in one of the buildings. I do ask myself however, why would a young company want to isolate themselves so much from the community by shoving themselves inside a polished building.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Now, as a scout, I have been to a lot of scary places. However, there is something especially sinister about these corporate environments. When you’re in a decaying place or neighborhood, at least you know the place is dying. However, in this instance, the death and decay is hidden behind a veneer of luxury. This makes it especially sinister if you ask.

                As I continue the long boring exploration of Industry City. I walk through stores ofter stores and begin to get annoyed. Haven’t we done this already? Is that the best developers can do? Take a collection of abandoned buildings, add retail stores on the first floor, put a few cool graffitis here and there, then try to sell us on this overpriced dessert.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Community is not built in a top down fashion. Nor is community built in block all at once like this. Community is a bottom up thing that should be gradually invested into. Cookie cutter, rinse and repeat, large development projects like Industry City or Hudson yards will fail. Hudson yards already had to get bailed by the city council for failing to make bond payments. Industry city will be no different. Why am I so certain of their failure? I am certain because these projects never had life to begin with.

                This sort of large neighborhood revitalization projects have been going on for a while now. As people, we have to start saying no. We have to start saying NO to fake communities, NO to fake businesses producing little value, NO to these central planning individuals isolated and shielded from the rest of society through a corporate wall. We’re tired of it. Stop buying at their stores, plain and simple.
