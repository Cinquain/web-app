                <h1>Finding Tesla's Deathplace</h1>
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                 There are two men who have profoundly affected my character. The first is Gustave Lebon, a french polymath,
                 the second is Nikola Tesla. I have lived in New York City for a combined period of about ten years, yet I never
                 knew that Nikola Tesla's deathplace was a mile walk away from the place I grab coffee every morning.
                 One day, as I walked near Penn Station, I noticed a small plaque on a wall.

        <br>
        

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Finding this plaque gave me a combination of intense joy and intense disappointment. It was great to spot
                the death-place of my childhood hero, but I was so disappointed with how small this memorial was. Considering
                what Nikola Tesla has done for the collective, we should have a statue of gold erected for this man at the 
                site where he passed away.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Nevertheless, feeling out of breath from excitement, I aimlessly walked around the hotel. I saw the 
                hotel entrance and spotted two doormen standing and being cordial. I started chatting with them and 
                mentioned that I saw the plaque on the wall informing that Tesla had died at this hotel. Yes! The doorman
                answered, he died at room 3327.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                 After a casual five minutes chatter with the two doormen, one of them informed me that there is a 
                 basement inside the hotel dedicated to Nikola Tesla, a sort of memorial for the great giant. He 
                 encouraged me to go take a look and mentioned that it was free to see. My eyes immediately opened, 
                 and I quickly jumped on that opportunity. I didn't even think twice.   
            </p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I walked inside the lobby and headed straight towards the stairs. As I walk in the direction for 
                downstairs, a hotel lobby attendent stops me and asked what was I searching for. I asked him if there 
                was a Tesla memorial downstairs and he promplty answered yes. 'I'm going there', I told him. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

            

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As I attempt to continue my journey towards the stairs, the lobby attendent stops me again and tells me 
                about this new resort the New York Hotel just opened. He tells me tell they are looking for individuals 
                to try out the resort in order to get some buzz going. He ask me if I would like to try it, it would be 
                free at no cost and I would receive dinner on the house. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                At this moment, the hotel attendent is becoming a nuissance more than anything. I tell him I came here 
                to see the Nikola Tesla memorial and perhaps afterwards I will listen to his pitch. I promptly head 
                downstairs without waiting for his answer and LO! It all became a magical moment.  
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I felt like I was at a magical place. Here stands this statue of Tesla (not of gold), there are photos of 
                Tesla, images that appear to be his patent drawings, etc. I immediately felt a buzz. I start taking photos 
                and begin doing my job as a scout- dropping this secret spot on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cityxcape/id1438755382">CityXcape app</a>
                As I post this secret spot on CityXcape, I notice the hotel attendent from upstairs walking in.
                As I am getting my historical fill, I speak to him about my job as a scout. He becomes fascinated by this 
                exploration lifestyle I tell him and wants me to try the resort even more. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                After a twenty minutes chatter with the hotel attendant, I accept his offer for dinner and an experience at
                his resort. I was rather skeptical of the long thing, but I figured why not give it a try. Turns out the deal 
                was real however. Not only had I found the deathplace of my hero but I got free travel goodies for doing so.
                This is what scout life is about, getting reward for just living your passion. That's it for this mission guys.
