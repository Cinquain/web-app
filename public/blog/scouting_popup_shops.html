                I have often noticed a slew of popup shops throughout the Union Square area and found them attractive. Lot of these pop ups are made up of wood, an element I have an affinity for. One day, I finally decided to check them out. Here was a scout’s experience.

                Walking through the wooden path between the pop up shops certainly has a cool feeling. I’m actually not sure why but I suspect it is because of the crowd. When an individual enters a crowd that blends with his or her energy, there is an elevated sense of euphoria. It’s very similar to the feeling one gets when they’re at a concert but less intense. So in terms of hive euphoria, these popups certainly score well in that department.

                Aside from feeling part of a hive, these popup shops are what I consider bump zones. Bump zones are areas where the potential of you running into someone and forming a potential relationship is higher than normal. The reason why pop ups are good potential zones is two folds. One, they have a crowd. Second, the amount of random objects which one can use to start a conversation is numerous. Thus any social advanced individual can walk around in a bump zone long enough to find a partner in crime.

            <p>
                Beside these two positives, there’s not much else going on at these pop ups if you ask me. There is no sense of community there, just strangers walking around looking at stuff. They weren’t any old timers cracking jokes about the good old days, no young kids playing, no teenagers acting mischievous, just people walking around shopping. These popup shops are just an outdoor mall if you ask me.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As a society, we are reaching a point where we no longer know how to get together as a community. Any collective gathering nowadays often requires the buying of stuff. This is quite a shame! Because as a people, Americans are already saturated with stuff. What we are longing for is connection.

                My small little visit to the popup shops invigorated my conviction that CityXcape is the right direction society wants to go. CityXcape is an app to find secret spots, but as you go check out these secret spots, you also meet other explorers looking on their journey. I encourage you to support me by <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cityxcape/id1438755382">downloading the app</a> and joining the Scout Life world I have form. Scout life will show you cool secret spots, historical markers, free amenities in the city, and of course, the ultimate goal is to connect you with other scout life members! Anyway, I’ve said enough! Keep exploring guys, Scout Life!
