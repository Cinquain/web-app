        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Having lived in California for the past ten years, coming back to New York felt out of place. The New York
                I left was no longer present. Something was different... I sensed New York City had become corporate. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As I started my scouting career in the city, I began to discover the old cultural elements I felt was missing
                in this new version of New York. This secret spot I am about to share with you is one of those things that 
                reminds me how wildly creative and gritty the old New York was. I call it the funkadeli elevator.     
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                When I first walked inside the elevator, I was completely blown away by the craftsmanship. As a hobbyist
                carpenter myself, I have the eyes and mental insight to appreciate great dexterity and mechanical abilities.
                The ceiling of the elevator has these strange faces staring at you from up above. Nice combination of creepy
                yet artistic.

                Outside is also a giant arm and hand made out of a schoolbus. It turns out this entire artpiece, 
                including the interior of the elevator was made out of junk metal. Can you imagine how creative and 
                dexterical the mind behind this must be?

                As I walked around the elevator, I began asking myself some questions. Who built this? Why? What is 
                the story behind this? ... I decided to investigate! Your job as a scout is not just finding secret 
                spots, you have get the story behind them. Being a scout to the bone, I decided to track down the 
                creator. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I began talking to security, doormen, janitors, building employees, anyone I can stop for chatter 
                and interrogation. I finally get told that the Facilities General Manager of the building across 
                possess the number of the artist I seek to track down. I waste no time and walk to the building 
                facing the one I'm in. I boldly walk to security and ask him for the facilities GM, my tone was 
                confident. Ironically, the GM was standing right near having a standup meeting with his team. The 
                security guard points him to me and I head over there. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I confidently walk to the GM, told him I was a scout, and that I was looking for the artist who 
                created the funky elevator across the street. I let him know that my intel told me he had the 
                artist's number. The GM calmly looks at me, pulls out his phone and gives me the artist's phone 
                number. I couldn't believe it my timing! 
            </p>

        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Getting the artist's phone number was one thing, but actually making him respond to my 
                phone calls and texts was another. I text him several times and tells him that I am a 
                scout, looking to do a story on his elevator... No Success!

                In one of my other scout missions where I found <a href="tesla_deathplace.html">Nikola Tesla's deathplace </a> 
                , I mentioned getting an offer for a free resort night as an experiment the hotel I was scouting was experimenting
                with. Well it turns out that the person who was processing me for this free night at the hotel was friends with 
                the artist who built the elevator... insane coincidence, I know! 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As the man processing my free night at the hotel asked what I did for work, I told him I was a scout and 
                showed him the elevator I was trying to get a story on. He casually said, oh I know the guy who built this, 
                he's a good friend of mine. My eyes opened up! I couldn't believe it. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                A bit baffled by the coincidence, I asked the man if he could text his friend on my behalf and get me an 
                interview I've been begging for quite some time. He agreed to do so but told me there would be no promises.
                He texted JJ (the artist) later that day, and I got the interview later that same week. You may view this 
                wonderful interview with Johny James <a href=""> at this link here.</a> What can I say guys, Scout Life!
