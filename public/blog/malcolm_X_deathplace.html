                As a big fan of Malcom X, going to the place where he was assassinated was no trivial matter.  There was a part of me that feeling excitement and another part of me feeling ashamed. While I was certainly excited to go see where the great man has died, I felt ashamed for living in New York City so long and not knowing this existed. I guess I was asleep in routine just like the rest of society. Anyway, here is the street report card on my experience there.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Walking towards the building I didn’t know what to expect. As I got from and center of the place, I took a pause to collect myself. I was a bit nervous. I walk in following a lady who opens the doors in front of me. As she started unlocking the second door, I realized she was facilities. She informed me I was the first person there today. I was glad! I wanted some alone time in this memorial.

        <div class="image-box">

            <h3>
                Malcolm X’s birthdate on far left. His muslim name in the middle. Assassination date on the right.

        <div class="paragraph">

                As the lady spoke, I noticed writings on the door. As a scout, you have to notice these small details. It turns out the date on the left is when Malcom X was born, the name in the middle is Malcom’s muslim name, and the date on the right is when Malcom was assassinated. 
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Anyway, I go inside the building and walk towards the statue of Malcolm. The vibes felt right, it felt like I needed to be there. I also take a photo and add this place as a secret spot on CityXcape for other scouts who are interested to come find it. 
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I walk up and ask what’s upstairs. The lady informs me that upstairs is the lecture hall where Malcom X got shot. To my great misfortune, she tells me upstairs is closed for reparation and will not be reopened until February 21st of 2020. I was sorely disappointed. 
            </p>

        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Interestingly enough, she suggested that I come back on the 21st around 5:30pm because Malcom X’s daughter will be speaking. You should meet her she says. Right then and there, that lady gave me my next mission- meet Malcom X’s daughter and get her to do an interview.  
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                She also tells me of Betty Shabazz, Malcom X’s wife. She apparently died from a house fire set by her grandson. The street this memorial is on by the way is named after her. Remember if you want to be a scout, you must always pay attention.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Lastly, she informs that the photo on the far left is the last one taken of Malcolm before he passed away. This photo was taken just three days before Malcom got shot, which is why I made it the thumbnail of this article…. I take one last look of Malcom, and I decide to walk away… but wait…
            </p>

        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                As I leave, the lady tells me: ‘Hey, you’re a nice man, why don’t I take you upstairs anyway’ and back inside I went. It’s moments like this that makes scouting so worth it.
            </p>

                Now I am not going to show you upstairs. Upstairs was simply too magical for me to share it. The spot is now on CityXcape, you can find it and come have your own experience. However, I will leave you with these words from Malcolm that I found upstairs.
