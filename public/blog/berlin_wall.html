                Life as a scout is full of surprises. You will run into things you least expect and come across souls that 
                make you wonder. As a lover of history, I am a big fan of the Berlin Wall. To me, it signifies so much. 
                In a very real sense, the Berlin Wall represents many conflicting ideologies. West versus East, democracy 
                vs autocracy, capitalism vs socialism, etc.

                I have never been to Germany but I always wanted to see the mighty wall for myself. Although the Berlin Wall 
                has fallen, remnants of it still remain in the great German city today and I certainly planned to go see and 
                touch it. However, it turns out that I did not have to fly to Berlin to make this dream become a reality. 
                The Berlin Wall was in my backyard this whole time in New York City.

                Yesterday as I explored Battery Park for a secret spot called the Irish Hunger Monument, I stumbled across 
                this piece of wall with a strange graffiti on it. Puzzled, I walked over and investigated. I would like to
                take a pause here and mention that much of your work as a scout consists of doing exactly that- spotting
                strange things and investigating. As I came over the graffitied wall, I notice a sign on its fence which 
                read the following:
            </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <br>



        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The last thing I expected was a piece of the Berlin Wall in the middle of New York City yet that is exactly 
                what I found. This piece of wall meant so much to me, I was rejoiced. As I stood around taking pictures and 
                video recording myself introducing the Berlin Wall to my audience, I noticed a small crowd gathering around 
                me puzzling in regards to what was going on. After enough idle stares, I paused and casually said: “This is 
                a piece of the Berlin Wall”. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Once I shouted what this wall was, I saw a glow behind the eyes of the people in the crowd. They now understood
                why this wall was special. One woman mentioned that she works nearby and pass this wall everyday yet was completely
                closely that this was part of the Berlin Wall. This point brings me to a second instance I’d like to mention to 
                you as a scout- that is, much of your job will be to make people realize the very magic under their nose. It isn’t 
                that people are zombies, they are simply distracted with work and the hustle and bustle of real life. As a scout, 
                you have the privilege of making daily exploring your living. Most people don’t live like that so it is your job 
                to make them stop sometimes and have them smell the flowers.

                After recording my video and snagging enough photos, I posted this secret spot on the 
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cityxcape/id1438755382">CityXcape app and moved on </a> 
                to the next exploration. What can I say? Life as a scout never gets old. Don't stop exploring guys!
