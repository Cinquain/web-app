                    I scouted Madison Avenue today. This exploration came by accident cause I tend to avoid glamorous street.
                     Nevertheless, I walked, I observed. What did I see? I saw remnants of an old past. A past where consumerism 
                     was the dominant religion. Many of us don’t know this but, when science broke the shackles of religion, 
                     our forefathers were left with a void. They needed something to believe in, and materialism is what they embraced.
