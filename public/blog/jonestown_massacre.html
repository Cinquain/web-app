                The next scout mission is a bit odd. It is to find the mass gravesite of Jonestown, the handy work of the cult leader named Jim Jones. This mission will require flying to the bay area. It turns out that Jim Jones’ headquarters temple was located in San Francisco. The FBI therefore created the mass gravesite and memorial in Oakland. Your job as a scout will require you to take a plane sometimes, but I’m sure you guys don’t mind.

                As I’m inside the plane, I read on the Jonestown incident that happened in 1978. Most of you reading this including myself weren’t even born yet. It’s good for our generation to revisit these things. Unless history is learned we are doomed to repeat it.

                A side element I discover as I do my homework on Jonestown is the origins of the street term “Drinking the Kool Aid”. It turns out Jim Jones mixed the poison he gave his followers with Kool aid as a flavor enhancer. Hence drinking the kool aid became a term to mean holding group beliefs without question. It’s random discoveries like that which makes you love your job as a scout.

                I finally got to San Francisco, a city I used to live in for five years. The city looks just as sterile I left it. Tomorrow I head for the site.

                As I stood there looking at the graves, I ask myself why did these people commit mass suicide! Well truth is we’ll never fully know but I bet it was out of desperation. These were people seeking a way out by trying to form their own world, which is ironically what CityXcape is about- forming worlds.

                Did you know that 70% of the Jonestown settlers were African Americans? There’s a reason for this. These were people looking for a way out of society in which they felt rejected them. They thought a charismatic leader and socialism was the answer. We now know it’s not!

                In our current time, we are susceptible to repeating similar mistakes. The economy is changing and many people feel rejected by the corporate hegemony. What most fail to realize is that corporations themselves do not feel any safer than the individual. The consumer economy is dying. As a society, we are beginning to place less value of stuff and more value on connection and experience. A lot of businesses can’t sit with this truth.

                Second, the economy is changing due to the rise of machines. The machine world is beginning to dawn upon us. That means any work that is mechanical and methodical will be eventually replaced. The solution is not socialist delusions like Jonestown, but humans inventing new dynamic lines of work… like scouting!
