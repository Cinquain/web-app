                This scout mission is to find the purchase site of Manhattan. So a quick historical backdrop for those of you who don’t know. Manhattan was allegedly purchased from the Lenape Indians by the Dutch for $60 worth of trinkets. Now as a scout, I tend to stay out of politics, but this idea that Manhattan being sold is more of an urban legend than it is history.

                First of all, the lenapes had no concept of land ownership. So chances are they had no idea what was taking place when the alleged transaction was taking place. Second, the Lenapes shared Manhattan with many other tribes. Therefore, they could not sell the island even if they wanted to. Third, and this is important. The so called receipt of this transaction is just a letter from a man named Peter Minuit to the Dutch government- just a letter.

                Anyway, our job as scouts is to find and verify information whether we ideologically agree with it or not. So I’m going to see this site for myself and check out what the memorial says.

                On my way to the site, I actually stumbled upon the miracle cross. It was originally held on display at the 9.11 museum, but it looks like it was transferred to a church in Washington Heights.

                For those of you who don't know, the miracle cross, also known as the ground zero cross are two I beams that were found within the debris of ground zero. Firefighters found it after days of digging bodies and took it as a divine sign. The cross was featured on the history channel and had lots of controversy around it. I added it as a secret spot on CityXcape for those of you who want to come see it.

                I finally arrive at Inwood Hill Park, which appears to be quite big and full of trees. So I walk, and I walk, and I walk… until finally, I find an unassuming stone with a sign in its vicinity.

                Indeed, the purchase site memorial is real. If you look close at the text, you will see that the story from Peter is regarded more as legend than history. The opening statement on the stone remarks “According to legends…”. I was glad to see this fact acknowledged.
