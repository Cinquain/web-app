                After scouting a few neighborhoods, he found gem locations that people overlooked. 
                These secret spots were pockets of fresh air. Places where you can be yourself and feel a sense of community. 
                As James found more and more secret spots, he began to bring friends. <br> <br>

                People liked the experience so much that they also began scouting. 
                This grew into a habit where people share secret spots with each other to keep life fresh and anew- CityXcape.
